# ELG 5255 Applied Machine Learning Project

## Dataset
Mobile CrowdSensing Dataset is used in this project.
Dataset is generated by CrowdSenSim simulation tool. Dataset contains legitimate tasks and fake tasks.
The task attributed are as follows: {â€™IDâ€™, â€™latitudeâ€™, â€™longitudeâ€™, â€™dayâ€™, â€™hourâ€™, â€™minuteâ€™, â€™durationâ€™, â€™remaining
timeâ€™, â€™battery requirement %â€™, â€™Coverageâ€™, â€™legitimacyâ€™, â€™GridNumberâ€™, â€™OnpeakHourâ€™}. Location of tasks are
specified by â€™latitudeâ€™ and â€™longitudeâ€™ together. Furthermore, â€™dayâ€™, â€™hourâ€™ and â€™minuteâ€™ describe the task
publish time. â€™Durationâ€™ denotes task active duration in terms of minutes. â€™Remaining timeâ€™ denotes the
residual time of a sensing task till its completion. â€™Battery requirementâ€™ is percentage of battery required
to complete a task. â€™Coverageâ€™ denotes task sensing distance. â€™Legitimacyâ€™ describes whether a task is
illegitimate one or legitimate one. This feature is used only in training of the machine learning models as
the MCS platform is unaware of task legitimacy when a task is submitted. â€™GridNumberâ€™ is obtained by
splitting sensing city map to small grids with numbers beginning at 1. â€™OnpeakHourâ€™ is a binary flag to
indicate if task start time occurs during 7am to 11am. We define 7am to 11am as the peak hour and other
hours are non-peak for the sake of simplicity in simulations. Based on the configuration of task
generation in Table 1, the dataset is created including total 14,484 tasks, with 12,587 legitimate tasks and
1,897 fake tasks, respectively.
